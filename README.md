# Quiz-Game

### About the app
+ It is a simple quiz game similar to google forms created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
+ The questions can be answered randomly and one question can only be answered once.
+ When the quiz gets completed, the result is displayed with a custom message.

### New techniques / algorithms / skills learned when building the project
+ Got to know about "transform: translate" feature of CSS which can also be used to center content.
+ Arrow function usage.
+ Got to brainstorm over how can the user randomly select any question to answer. This was implemented using "onmouseover" function in javascript which took some time to build.
+ Basic animation use.
+ Enhancing skills in Javascript button interaction.
+ Got to learn how to freeze the selected options so that it cannot be answered again. 

### Challenges faced and conquered:
+ Showing correct content. That means the correct use of "display: none" and "display: block" functions at correct time.
+ Random question answering was a bit time consuming and challenging for me as it was my very first intermediate scale project. It took some time to figure it out how to do it. And it can be done better now.

### Scope of betterment
+ Additonal changes can be applied such as time bounded quiz, dynamically changing options, custom created question by the user and a lot more.
